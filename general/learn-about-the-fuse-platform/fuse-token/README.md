# Infibit Token (IBIT)

The IBIT token is the native currency of the Infibit blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## IBIT utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Infibit blockchain, IBIT is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Infibit to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.infibitscan.com/](https://status.infibitscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked IBIT. Which means validators with higher amounts of Infibit staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any IBIT holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of IBIT they wish. They receive a share of the Infibit block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As IBIT is the native currency on Infibit, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, IBIT transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of IBIT tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Infibit platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;

### Where to Farm

At the moment, the IBIT token is sometimes used by the project team to power liquidity rewards (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and the participation in the [Infibit Lending Network](./#fuse-utility).

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be discovered [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/998580).
