# Infibit Mobile Infrastructure Use Cases

Given its easily customizable character, Infibit's mobile-centric infrastructure for issuing tokens and creating communities around them has a wide range of potential applications.

Companies and other organizations can use either Infibit Studio or Infibit Studio in conjunction with a customized version of Infibit Wallet to create tokens to be used by users onboarded either to their proprietary app or a fork of Infibit Wallet. They can also whitelist businesses for the token community ecosystem and activate fiat on-ramps.

In what follows, we would like to provide a few already implemented token community use cases for illustration.

## A Stable Currency for a Local Economy

## A Customer Rewards Token and Food Delivery app

## A Festival Payments Token

## A Solution for Streamlining Charitable Donations
